> Hybrid between "Post-it", "Post, dammit!" and "Post them!"

A simple web app to write and store post-its built with **Vite**, **React**, **Tailwind** and **Motion**.

## Features

* **Post-it Management System**: Allows users to create, edit, and delete post-its easily for full control over their notes.
* **Customizable Appearance**: Users can choose the post-it color, font, and text color from a predefined selection for better visual organization.
* **Flexible Sorting Options**: Post-its can be ordered by creation or last edit date, in ascending or descending order (newest or oldest first).
* **Adaptive Layout Control**: Users can select the number of columns in the board for optimal visibility — 1, 2, 3, or as many as fit on the screen.
* **Persistent Storage**: Post-its are saved in localStorage along with layout settings, sorting preferences, and the configuration of the most recently created post-it.
